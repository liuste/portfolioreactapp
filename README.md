# portfolioreactapp
Portfolio app 

Master branch: First step. Completed so far, the app allows the user to enter their name to create a profile, login to their profile, and delete their profile.  Practiced using react, react-router, react portals, styled components, dynamic CSS-grid, Flexbox, CSS frameworks, and CRUD operations adhering to RESTful API.

Redux branch: Implemented Redux, redux-thunk, redux form in portfolioreact projected. CreateProfile, EnterInfo, and DeleteProfile components all working. Still need to implement routing and UI.
